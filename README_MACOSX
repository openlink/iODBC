How to build iODBC for Mac OS X


  Copyright (C) 1996-2018 by OpenLink Software <iodbc@openlinksw.com>


Method 1: Using Project builder

You first need to install the latest Mac OS X Developer Packages, which can be
found at:

  http://developer.apple.com/tools

Then execute the following commands from a terminal session to build all the
frameworks and demo applications:

  $ cd mac
  $ make

After building the iODBC libraries and applications, you have to install them
on your system with the command:

  $ sudo make install

This installs the iODBCinst and iODBC frameworks into:

  /Library/Frameworks/iODBC.framework
  /Library/Frameworks/iODBCinst.framework

and the test applications iodbctest and iodbctestw into:

  /Library/Application Support/iODBC/bin

and the iODBC Administrator and the iODBC Demo applications in:

  /Applications/iODBC


iODBC Administrator

Now that you have installed the iODBC frameworks on your system, you are able
to use ODBC applications or build your own applications using the iODBC API.
Once you have installed an ODBC Driver, you can configure a new ODBC DSN using
either the 32bit Cocoa UI which can configure and test any ODBC driver that is
build in universal mode:
/Applications/iODBC/iODBC Administrator.app
or the 64bit version which can configure drivers that only support a 64bit
Cocoa UI:

   /Applications/iODBC/iODBC Administrator64.app


Test DSN connection

Once you have configured a DSN, you will be able to make a connection using the
iodbctest command which is located in:

  /Library/Application Support/iODBC/bin/iodbctest


Method 2: Using configure and make

The iODBC package can also be build like any other Open Source package not
using any frameworks.
On Mac OS X 10.10 and newer, Apple removed a number of programs from their
Xcode.app commandline installation including the autoconf, automake, libtool,
and some other tools needed to build iODBC from a newly checked out GIT tree.
We suggest using the HomeBrew_package_manager to install these tools.
To build the libraries, open up a terminal session and execute the following
commands:

  $ sh autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make

To install the header files and libraries in /usr/local, you execute the
following command as administrator:

  $ sudo make install

Note that this will build all code based that only runs on the CPU type you
build it on, so PowerPC on older systems, 32bit Intel on early CoreDuo machine
and 64bit on current models.
However iODBC can also be configured to build a universal library that works
with all 3 models embedded.

Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6

The following commands will build a release of iODBC that works on both Mac OS
X 10.5 as well as Mac OS X 10.6:

  $ CFLAGS="-O -arch ppc -arch i386 -arch x86_64"
  $ CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk"
  $ CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -mmacosx-version-min=10.5"
  $ export CFLAGS

  $ sh autogen.sh
  $ ./configure \
  --disable-dependency-tracking \
  --prefix=/usr/local/iODBC.universal

  $ make
  $ sudo make install


Mac OS X 10.7 and above

The following commands will build a release of iODBC that works on both Mac OS
X 10.7 and newer:

  $ CFLAGS="-O -arch i386 -arch x86_64"
  $ CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -mmacosx-version-min=10.7"
  $ export CFLAGS

  $ sh autogen.sh
  $ ./configure \
  --disable-dependency-tracking \
  --prefix=/usr/local/iODBC.universal

  $ make
  $ sudo make install


Test DSN connection

Once you have installed an ODBC driver and configured a DSN, you will be able
to make a connection using the iodbctest command which is located in:

  /usr/local/iODBC.universal/bin/iodbctest
