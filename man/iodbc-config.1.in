.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iodbc-config 
.RB [ \-\-prefix\fI[=DIR]\fR ] 
.RB [ \-\-exec\-prefix\fI[=DIR]\fR ] 
.RB [ \-\-version ]
.RB [ \-\-cflags ]

.RB [ \-\-static\-libs ] 
.RB [ \-\-libtool\-libs ]
.RB [ \-\-odbcini ] 
.RB [ \-\-odbcinstini ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBiodbc-config\fR is a tool that is used to configure to determine
the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile
and link programs that use \fRiODBC\fR. 
.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBiodbc-config\fR accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of \fBiODBC\fR on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile an \fBiODBC\fR program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an \fBiODBC\fR program using
dynamic libraries (if supported).
.TP 8
.B  \-\-static\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an \fBiODBC\fR program using 
static libraries.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libtool\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an \fBiODBC\fR program in a
libtool environment.
.TP 8
.B \-\-odbcini
Print the path of the system wide odbc.ini file.
.TP 8
.B \-\-odbcinstini
Print the path of the system wide odbcinst.ini file.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix\fI[=PREFIX]\fR
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that \fBiODBC\fR
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.

If PREFIX is not specified, the \fB\-\-prefix\fR flag shows where \fBiODBC\fR
is currently installed.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-exec\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that
\fBiODBC\fR was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.

.SH EXAMPLES
To compile a program that calls the \fBiODBC\fR API, make sure the
\fBiodbc\-config\fR program can be found in the \fBPATH\fR environment
variable, before using the following Makefile fragment:

.nf
    CFLAGS=\`iodbc-config \-\-cflags\`
    LDLIBS=\`iodbc-config \-\-libs\`

    iodbctest: iodbctest.c
	    cc $(CFLAGS) \-o iodbctest iodbctest.c $(LDLIBS)
